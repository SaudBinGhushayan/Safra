# Safra

 - Safra is a social network app for trip guides and recommendations.
It can help users to view each other trips and have a glimpse of the activities at their destinations

##	Project Introduction
- Safra is an application that guides the user in his trips. He can create trips manually, generate trips from predefined entered interests and finally as Safra
  is a social network application the user can search for the top-rated trips over the Safra network and get ideas from other travelers or even on some cases
  create the same trip. Safra allows the users to comment on each other activities in the network. There is a timeline for every trip in Safra with the
  activities and its specification so the user will have a good sight of what’s next. Safra allows the user to add members to the trip and members are 
  allowed to view the timeline.
  
## Problem Statement 
- 	Many users find it hard to plan for their trip. Sometimes they plan it by memorizing the activities that they are going to do or write it on paper. With Safra you can plan your trip to the preferred destination and even get a timeline with the selected activities. Users can view the trips of other travelers on the preferred destination if the destination is new to them and they have never gone there.

## Project Goals
- 	Safra's main focus is on the satisfaction of the user and the easy user interface. Safra's main goal is to help various travelers that are going to a new destination to get a glimpse on what are the things to do and create a timeline for the activities that they choose.

## Development Tools
 ### Draw.io  
- Draw.io is an application that used for designing UML diagrams, all the diagrams in this report was designed using drow.io
### Figma 
- Figma is used for designing prototype and user interface, Figma has easy interface and more convenient than other design apps, and we designed our prototype with Figma.
### Flutter (Programming) 
- Flutter is Google’s portable UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.
### Visual Studio Code (Code editor)
- Visual Studio Code (Code editor) Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE. 
### Android studio (emulator)
-  Android studio (emulator) The Android Emulator installs and starts your apps faster than a real device and allows you to prototype and test your app on various Android device configurations: phones, tablets, Android Wear, and Android TV devices. You can also simulate a variety of hardware features such as GPS location, network latency, motion sensors, and multi-touch input.
#### ⦁	Python (flask framework) – to deal with API.
#### ⦁	Next.Js  (Java Script frame work) – used for admin page.

## Implementation 
-  System implementation is the process of defining how the information system should be built, ensuring that the information system is operational and used, ensuring that the information system meets quality standard. In this part, we will show you how System implementation has been done from where required hardware and software resources that helped us. following to that  we provide our test plan and results to test the main functionalities of our product   so we can launch it with the required outcomes. Source code of an overall
Application from the first version until last version explaining the changes that have occurred. User guide for the suggested system. Finally, we showed how the system is installed so you can explore the system on your own.
